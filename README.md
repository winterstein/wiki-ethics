# wiki-ethics

TODO a database of company ethical reports

I was shopping the other day, and wanted to make "ethical" buying
choices (i.e. avoid scumbag companies) -- but not having the info to
hand, I didn't. I expect this is pretty common.

So later I went and looked for a website or database covering company
ethics. And I couldn't find one. So I asked the hive minds of
WikiMedia and Quora, but got no suggestions. 

Do you know of a website
that lists the good and bad on company behaviour? If so, please message me!

So I thought: maybe I try making something. A simple web-app where you
can put in a company name, and get a short report of their good & bad
points. It'd be backed by a wiki, much like Wikipedia. I'd seed it by
collecting data from people who already collect such data.
